title: Don't cheat

description: Course integrity policy.
---

This policy statement is unfortunately necessary, thanks to the actions of a tiny minority of students. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to ask during the lecture, lab, office hours, on Piazza, or by email.

[TL;DR] Be honest. Cite your sources. We mean it. If you need help, please ask. <!-- Don't be stupid! -->

#### Our expectations

**Each student (or homework group) must write their own solutions, in their own words, and must properly credit all sources.**

For more information and examples, refer to the following.

- The ECE department [policy](https://ece.illinois.edu/academics/ugrad/advising-tips/academic-honesty).
- The Provost Office's Students' [Quick Reference Guide to Academic Integrity](https://provost.illinois.edu/policies/policies/academic-integrity/students-quick-reference-guide-to-academic-integrity/).
- [Article 1, Part 4 of the Student Code.](https://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part4/1-401/)

If you have any doubts about whether something constitutes plagiarism, talk to the instructor(s) or the TAs, and err on the side of caution.

###### Cite your sources

We strongly encourage you to use any printed, online, or living resource at your disposal to help you solve homework problems, but you must cite your sources.

- If you use an idea from a book, cite the book.
- If you use an idea from a paper, cite the paper.
- If you use an idea from Wikipedia, cite Wikipedia.
- If you use an idea from CS StackExchange, cite CS StackExchange.
- If you use an idea from last semester's homework solutions, cite last semester's homework solutions.
- If you use an idea from another student, cite that student.
- If you use an idea from your mom, cite your mom.

There are only two exceptions to this rule. **You are not required to cite the following:**

- Official course materials (lectures, lecture notes, homework, and exam solutions *from this semester*).
- Sources for prerequisite material (which we assume you already know by heart).

#### Penalties

- The default penalty for cheating on a homework problem is *a full letter grade off your final course grade*.
- The default penalty for cheating on an exam is *two full letter grades off your final course grade*
- The default penalty for cheating on an attendance sheet (should we choose to collect attendance) is *a full letter grade off your final course grade*.
- The default penalty for cheating on multiple assignments is an F in the course. Doesn't matter if this is your first violation or your third. A consistent pattern of cheating in the course is grounds for immediate failure. 
- We reserve the right to register FAIR violations at any point in the semester (even once the semester is over). FAIR violations are time-consuming for the staff so multiple cheating offenses could be included in a single violation. 

<!-- Don't be an idiot. Just do the work.-->
