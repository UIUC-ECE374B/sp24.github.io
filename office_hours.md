#### Office hours
Office hours will be conducted by the instructor(s), TAs and CAs. Office hours are not a place to check if your homework solutions are correct (the CAs do not even have access to the homework solutions). Office hours are meant to help you master the course concepts and assist you in working through any assignments when you are stuck.
